# The [MOOC](https://lms.fun-mooc.fr/courses/course-v1:ulb+44013+session06/info) in question

## What did I learn from this ?
### Python is garbage that:
* Had no switch statements (3.10)
* Doesn't have pattern matching in function arguments
* Cannot unpack iterables in comprehensions
* Disallows returning from files for no good reason
