# The [MOOC](https://lms.fun-mooc.fr/courses/course-v1:ulb+44013+session06/info) in question

## What did I learn from this ?
### Python isn't that good, it:
* The only Scoping unit in Python is a Function?????!!!
* Had no switch statements (3.10)
* Doesn't have tuple pattern matching in function arguments
* Cannot unpack iterables in comprehensions
* Disallows returning from files for no good reason
* `range` only supports `int`egers
* Exceptions are unironically used for control flow???
* `for` `else` is a thing
